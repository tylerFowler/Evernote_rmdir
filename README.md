Evernote rmdir
============================
Are you like me and have a steady pile of growing notes that were once reminders? Unfortunately, Evernote doesn't offer an option to delete all reminders in your account that are marked as completed, and so now I have about a dozen useless notes in my personal notebook marked "go grocery shopping" or "study for that exam tomorrow!"

This kind of thing causes me grief, so I thought I'd write a simple .NET Windows application that deletes these unwanted reminders. Evernote rmdir will go through your account, per your criteria (searching certain notebooks, excluding reminders with a certain tag, or excluding the reminders that were marked as completed within a certain number of days) and move these notes to the trash. 

Protip: because of the way this tool queries your Evernote account, when you set what tag to exclude, you can use a bit of Evernote's searching lingo. For example if you type in "a*" then it will exclude every reminder with a tag that starts with the letter a. (For a more complete list of searching terms: http://dev.evernote.com/doc/articles/search_grammar.php)

####Feature List (so far)
- Only delete reminders that have been marked as completed for a certain number of days
- List view to select the notebooks to include in the deletion
- Exclude reminders with a particular tag

####To Do:
- Test the query to the Evernote API (more thoroughly)
- Implement OAuth (just uses the developer sandbox right now)
- Add an undo button

###How to Use:
1. Open the Evernote rmdir.sln file
2. In EvernoteDevAuth.cs change the value of ```authToken``` on line 30 to your developer token
3. If you are using a Sandbox account, then make sure line 96 is uncommented and line 99 is commented out (in sandbox, you're NoteStore URL is generated by a method call)
   - If you are wanting to use a personal account, go to Evernote's website and get your Developer Token and NoteStore URL (for more information go [here](http://dev.evernote.com/doc/articles/authentication.php#devtoken)) and set ```noteStoreUrl``` on line 99 to the one given to you on the Evernote site. The Developer Token goes in the same place as if you were using a Sandbox account.
4. Now run Build -> Rebuild Solution (in Visual Studio), then you should be able to find the binary in ```Evernote_rmdir/Evernote rmdir/bin/Release```
